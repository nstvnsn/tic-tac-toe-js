# tic-tac-toe-js

A simple Javascript game to familiarize myself with the language before moving on to React.

Very early stages of the project.

Current State:
  -Blue canvas divided into 9 tiles.
  -Clicks are tracked.
  -Depending on the tile clicked, an X or an O will appear
  -Dimensions and positions are based off of the canvas element on the html page,
  game scales with element nicely
  
Known Issues: 
  -Adjust positions/sizes of tiles to reduce their click areas away from the dividing lines
